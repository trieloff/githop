# githop â€“ Hop into your Development Environment from Git

What if you could just hop into a ready-made development environment with all your favorite tools simply by providing a Git Remote URL?

* supports Java, Node, Clojure and ClojureScript development

## Usage

```bash
$ githop <origin> <upstream> <other> <other>
```

```
$ githop :java <origin> <upstream> <other> <other>
```
