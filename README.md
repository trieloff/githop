# githop â€“ Hop into your Development Environment from Git

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/trieloff/githop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/trieloff/githop)

What if you could just hop into a ready-made development environment with all your favorite tools simply by providing a Git Remote URL?

*githop* uses Git, Docker, and ZSH to do this for you. All you need is a running Docker, and the `githop` shell script.

## Features

* Works on macOS and Linux
* (on macOS only) mounts your working directory from the container
* supports Java, Node, Clojure and ClojureScript development

### What's inside?

- Default shell: `zsh`
- Shell window and session management with `tmux`
- `http` client: HTTPIE (`curl` is available, too)
- `git`, `tig`, and `git icdiff`
- `bat`, `mdv`, `jq`, `tldr`
- `micro`
- `wsk`

## Usage

```bash
$ githop <origin> <upstream> <other> <other>
```

```
$ githop :java <origin> <upstream> <other> <other>
```

Following tags are supported:

- `:java` for Java and Maven
- `:node` for Node and NPM
- `:clojure` for Java, Maven, Clojure, Leiningen
- `:clojurescript` for Java, Maven, Clojure, Leiningen, Node, NPM, Lumo
